- Sometimes, under strong pressure and temperature, an eruption occurs and solidifies in the form of crystals on the walls of the hole. This is how pixel deposits came about.
- It was near these sources that the first intelligent pixel race appeared, which learned to concentrate pixels and extract them.
- Sometimes the eruption can be repeated, flooding a huge area.
- During eruptions, beetles can hit the surface in large numbers. Usually beetles gnaw their way to the surface and develop there.
- Due to interaction with the atmosphere and low surface pressure, Px crystallizes.
